  <h2>What</h2>

  <p>Pdxactivist.org is a collaborative community calendar we have created to move information about activism and resistance in Portland out of corporate silos like Facebook. This is a place to share protests, assemblies, direct actions, and other events that are open to public participation.</p>

  <p>This site is built using <a href="https://github.com/calagator">Calagator</a>, an open source project founded in 2008 by members of Portland's technology community.</p>

  <h2>Who</h2>

  <p>The organizers of this project include <a href="http://lifeofaudrey.com">Audrey Eschright</a> (<a href="https://twitter/com/ameschright">@ameschright</a>) and Sam Scott (<a href="https://twitter.com/duckasaurusss/">@duckasaurusss</a>).</p>

  <p>Anyone can contribute! If you share our goals of making Portland better through active resistence to oppression, we'd love to have your help.</p>

  <p>Please add events you know about to the calendar. We've made it easy to bring info over from Facebook and Meetup: all you have to do is grab the link to the event page and paste it in on <%= link_to "our import page", new_source_path %>.</p>

  <h4>Help garden the calendar</h4>
  <p>Anyone can edit an event to add details or correct something that's changed. Put [POSTPONED] or [CANCELLED] in the event title to reflect those statuses. You'll find the edit link in the sidebar to the right of the event details.</p>

  <p>We also need your help to keep an eye out for spam or inappropriate content. If you're not sure whether to make a change to the event (or anything else goes wrong on the site) you can <a href="https://github.com/pdxactivist/pdxactivist/issues">make a report</a> (click "New Issue") or contact an organizer on Twitter.</p>
